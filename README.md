There are two blocks on the page. Each of them is like a to-do list, i.e, text can be added to the list. On adding text to one list, it gets added to the other list also (via an API).

The user should be able to drag these lists individually, and place them anywhere on the viewport.

app in react(front end) + node js(back end)
